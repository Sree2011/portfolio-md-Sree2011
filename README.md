# Welcome to My Portfolio

## ðŸ’« About Me

Hi there! I'm **Sree Sai Nandini Gundraju**, currently working as a **Packaged App Development Associate at Accenture**. I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** from **Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College**, and Iâ€™m passionate about blending power systems knowledge with innovative software development.

I specialize in **C**, **Java**, **Python**, **MATLAB**, and **Arduino UNO**, and I recently earned the **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Certification (AZ-900)** â€” boosting my confidence in cloud computing and expanding my problem-solving toolkit.

As a **former Student Coordinator for ISTE**, I gained hands-on experience in leadership, communication, and collaboration. My academic journey includes multiple technical projects, including a Grade B-rated team project under **IUCEE Project-Based Learning**, where I explored empathetic design for children with autism.

Iâ€™m fascinated by the intersection of **electrical systems and IT**, and I aspire to build solutions that ensure seamless communication between components, platforms, and people. I thrive on the joy of learning, adapting, and seeing the real-world impact of my work.

Letâ€™s connect to collaborate on impactful tech, explore new ideas, or just talk shop!
