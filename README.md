# Welcome to My Portfolio

## 💫 About Me

Hi there! I’m **Sree Sai Nandini Gundraju**, a Software Developer at **Accenture** with 2.5 years of experience in **cloud development (Azure, AWS)** and **backend engineering**. I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering** from Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College, where I combined systems knowledge with innovative software projects.  

I specialize in **Java, Python, C, MATLAB, and Arduino**, and recently earned the **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ‑900)** and **GitHub Copilot (GH‑300)** certifications, strengthening my expertise in cloud computing and AI‑assisted development. My academic journey includes impactful projects such as the **Smart Walking Stick for Blind People (SRP)** and the **Solar PV Multipurpose Charger (SRP)**, as well as participation in **IUCEE Project‑Based Learning** with the *Toys for Autistic Kids* initiative. These experiences reflect my commitment to building solutions that are both technically sound and socially meaningful.  

Beyond technical skills, I’ve gained hands‑on leadership and collaboration experience as a **Student Coordinator for ISTE**, and I thrive on learning, adapting, and creating solutions with real‑world impact. Currently, I’m preparing to transition into product‑based companies like **Amazon, Google, and Microsoft**, while expanding my skills in **REST APIs, Docker, Kubernetes, and MongoDB**.  

Let’s connect to collaborate on impactful tech, explore new ideas, or share insights on cloud and backend innovation!
