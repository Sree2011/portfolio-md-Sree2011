Hello! I’m Sree Sai Nandini Gundraju, a Packaged App Development Associate at Accenture with a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College.

I specialize in C, Java, Python, MATLAB, and Arduino UNO, and recently earned the **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Certification**, enhancing my cloud computing skills. My passion lies in developing innovative solutions that drive efficiency and effectiveness.

As a former Student Coordinator for the Indian Society for Technical Education, I honed my leadership and coordination skills. My academic journey includes two projects and a Grade B IUCEE PBL project, showcasing my teamwork and project management abilities.

I aim to bridge power systems with IT, ensuring seamless communication between components. I thrive on seeing the direct impact of my work and continuously learning new technologies.
